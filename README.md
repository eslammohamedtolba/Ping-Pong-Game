# Ping-Pong-Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Ping Pong game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. 
The game features two paddles and a ball, with the goal being to score points by hitting the ball past your opponent’s paddle. The first player to reach 10 points wins the game.

## Game Controls
Player 1 (Right Paddle):
Move Up: Up Arrow Key
Move Down: Down Arrow Key

Player 2 (Left Paddle):
Move Up: ‘W’ Key
Move Down: ‘S’ Key

## Game Rules
Each player controls a paddle on their side of the screen. The ball starts in the center and moves towards one of the paddles.
The objective is to hit the ball with your paddle and make it past the opponent’s paddle. If the ball hits the top or bottom wall, it bounces back. 
If the ball hits a paddle, it bounces off in the opposite direction. If the ball goes past a paddle, the opposing player scores a point.
The game continues until one player reaches the maximum score or until you exit the game.
